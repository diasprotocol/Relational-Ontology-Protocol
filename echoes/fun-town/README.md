Part of the **Hidden in Plain Sight** series — exploring how design, language, and symbols say more than they mean. Each image functions as a relational ontology fragment: a vessel for meaning transfer across time, context, and interpretation.

“Welcome to FUN TOWN!”  
A phrase that promises joy before you even cross the threshold. Bright, clean, manufactured happiness — the illusion of ease. The sign is so literal it becomes surreal.  

The perfection of the kerning, the green border, the palm fronds — everything about this image is designed to feel cheerful, frictionless, and safe. And yet, that’s precisely what makes it uncanny. This is not joy; it’s the *performance* of joy.  

**Relational Notes**  
- *Theme:* performance / simulation / commodified emotion  
- *Emotional field:* nostalgia, irony, yearning for simplicity  
- *Ontology tag:* surface > substance  
- *Relational pull:* childhood, escape, illusion  
- *Echo intent:* reveal how happiness is manufactured
