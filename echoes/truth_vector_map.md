summary: >
  A quick visual + tabular map of how each echo sits across two axes:
  (1) Entropy ↔ Energy and (2) Irony ↔ Sincerity. Values are normalized to [-1, 1].

# Truth Vector Map

This page orients the **Hidden in Plain Sight** echoes inside a simple polarity field:

- **Axis X — Entropy ↔ Energy**  
  -1 = maximum **entropy** (decay, futility, collapse)  
  +1 = maximum **energy** (momentum, activation, optimism)

- **Axis Y — Irony ↔ Sincerity**  
  -1 = maximum **irony** (absurdism, critique, double meanings)  
  +1 = maximum **sincerity** (directness, earnest intent)

Use it as a quick *semantic atlas* for talks, writing, and agent parsing.
