America the Beautiful!  
Ca$h for guns.

The double outline and hand-drawn gun silhouette say everything: design as literacy, commerce as culture. Even if you can’t read, you can still make the pawn happen.  

This is typography as intent. The dollar sign as both symbol and sermon.  
Step right up to your friendly neighborhood strip mall — where concrete blocks grant permanence to the absurd.  

Part of the **Hidden in Plain Sight** series — exploring how design, language, and symbols say more than they mean. Each image functions as a relational ontology fragment: a vessel for meaning transfer across time, context, and interpretation.
