Part of the **Hidden in Plain Sight** series — exploring how design, language, and symbols say more than they mean. Each image functions as a relational ontology fragment: a vessel for meaning transfer across time, context, and interpretation.

A laminated, hand-marked *Warning: Keep Out — Poison — Baited Area* notice stapled to a green wall on a New York City street. You can see the staples. You can see the wrinkles. You can feel the indifference.  

It’s not trying to communicate beauty — it’s trying to communicate *threat*. Yet because it’s so direct, it crosses over. The warning becomes art. The plastic sleeve, a gesture of preservation. The handwritten date, a timestamp of bureaucratic sincerity. The skull isn’t symbolic anymore; it’s literal.  

And somehow, it ends up saying everything about modern semiotics: we no longer need metaphor, because the message itself *is* the art.

**Relational Notes**  
- *Theme:* authority / fear / entropy  
- *Emotional field:* unease, fascination, irony  
- *Ontology tag:* control ↔ decay  
- *Relational pull:* the intimacy of bureaucracy  
- *Echo intent:* aestheticize the warning; reveal beauty in bluntness
