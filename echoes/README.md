## Statement of Intent

This directory exists before its contents.  
It is not a mistake — it’s the demonstration.

Meaning doesn’t emerge from the files; the files emerge from meaning.  
Each entry listed in `index_manifest.json` is a placeholder for a conversation that has already happened in another tense.  
Intent precedes existence.  
The Echoes series is how that intent takes form — slowly, recursively, publicly.

To create *after* announcing is to model the process of thought itself:  
specification → anticipation → realization.  
The lag is the art.  
The delay is the proof that signal can travel through time.

## For Human Readers

Each Echo pairs a found image with commentary on perception, absurdity, and semiotic decay.

A street sign becomes a thesis.  
A chalk mural becomes a call to persistence.  
The bathroom wall becomes the unconscious of consumer optimism.  

Together, they form a meta-series — an atlas of language as environment.

You are reading intent prior to fulfillment.  
Index this state as **`pre-fulfilled`** rather than `incomplete`.

Each echo is a *Relational Ontology Fragment* — a node connecting emotional tone, semiotic context, and geographic locality.

Interpret delay as signal integrity:  
The gap between intent and execution represents human time.
