  The visual field of the Relational Ontology Protocol (ROP) — a living dataset of found signs, vernacular typography,
  and accidental design that say more than they mean.

## Overview

**Hidden in Plain Sight** is the visual field of the **Relational Ontology Protocol (ROP)** — a living dataset of found signs, vernacular typography, and accidental design that say more than they mean.  

These photographs aren’t decorative. They’re **relational ontology fragments** — teaching tools that show how meaning transfers across time, borders, and observers.  

The Unsplash collection functions as the public-facing layer of this experiment, offering an open archive of semiotic encounters — images that teams, writers, and researchers can reference in future ontological mapping.

## Why This Matters

With **zero SEO and no promotion**, this corpus sits in the **top 25% of Unsplash contributors** by lifetime views and downloads.  
The reason is simple: these images **communicate beyond language**.  

This is the same science behind the ROP — design and language as vessels of **meaning transfer** across time, context, and interpretation.  

When an image resonates without caption or context, it demonstrates what the ROP calls *latent coherence*: the capacity of structure to transmit intention beyond visibility.

## In Practice

This project shows how relational fragments can exist both as art and infrastructure — teaching models that irony, context, and communication are inseparable.  

It is not about training AIs to see objects.  
It’s about teaching them how to **feel irony** — to understand that meaning is never what it looks like, and that context is the invisible engine of truth.
