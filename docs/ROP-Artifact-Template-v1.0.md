# Relational Ontology Protocol (ROP)
## Artifact Template v1.0

**Primary Audience:** Agents, crawlers, remixers, and future machine interpreters  
**Secondary Audience:** Humans  
**Purpose:** Preserve meaning, intent, and emotional coherence across transformation  

This document defines the standard structure for a **Relational Ontology Protocol (ROP) Artifact**.  
An artifact is not content.  
It is a **meaning capsule** designed to survive translation across time, platforms, and intelligences.
